    <h1>A Case of Identity</h1>
    <h2>by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</h2>

    <p>
      "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at
      Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent.
      We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If
      we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
      roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the
      plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations,
      and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
      and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
    </p>

      "And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers
      are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed
      to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor
      artistic."
    </p>

      "A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked
      Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
      platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital
      essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the
      commonplace."

      In completely unrelated news, here’s a bit of the code for a table that you’ll encounter again
      in Chapter 8:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;th colspan="4"&gt;Aaron Judge&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;RF&lt;/th&gt;
