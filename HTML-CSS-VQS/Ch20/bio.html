                <p class="intro">Don’t let Joe Casabona’s <em>Master’s Degree in Computer Science</em> intimidate you; he is a passionate and approachable guy.</p>

                <p>Joe started his career <strong>almost 20 years</strong> ago as a freelance web developer and has been a team lead, system admin, and was even a faculty member at his alma mater, <i>The University of Scranton</i>. Podcasting has been the perfect medium for Joe to share his knowledge and build up his peers. He is not only a veteran podcaster but he helps people launch their own podcasts.</p>

                <h2>Educator and Family Man</h2>

                <p>When he’s not creating courses or writing books, you can find Joe spending time with his family, enjoying baseball (go <b>Yankees</b>!)  or watching <i>Star Wars</i>.</p>

                <p>His book, <u class="highlight">HTML and CSS: Visual QuickStart Guide, 9th Edition</u>, is out now.</p>
